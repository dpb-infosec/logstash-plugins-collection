# Logstash Syslog Codec Plugin

This is the **syslog codec plugin** for [Logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash). This plugin implements a custom syslog parser that supports both **octet counting** and **newline-delimited** framing. It provides enhanced automatic syslog message parsing(all RFC) and formatting capabilities, making it easier to ingest and process syslog data in Logstash.

This plugin is fully free and open source under the Apache 2.0 license, meaning you can use it however you want.
